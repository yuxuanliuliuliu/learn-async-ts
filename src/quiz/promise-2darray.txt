- Extract the code in the setTimeout function and replace the setTimeout function  with the extracted code. Then run the main script. 
- Is there a difference in the flow of execution from when the code was in the setTimeout function?
yes. Without settime out the summation happens immediately after sum is called.
- Is the flow of execution in both these examples different from the flow of execution with the examples using the fetch() API, which also returns a promise?
yes.
- If yes, explain the code execution difference. Add your explanation to this file.
with settimeout function last line of code get executed regardless of sum or fetch function completed or not.Summation is not
happen immediately. The result of these two functions is returned after last line of code finished. Without setTimeout, the
execution is sequential. We can see function get called and then immediately it computes summation and then ends the function.
